# gomoku_ai_gpu

Gomoku is a fascinating game that has yet to be played well by a computer program due to its large board size and exponential time complexity. This report applies the reinforcement learning algorithm Q-learning to this game.The Q-Learning algorithm was proposed as a way to optimize solutions in Markov decision process problems and reduce algotithm developed bu us. With the emergence of CUDA, Nvidiaâ€™s massively parallel GPU platform, Markov decision process can be parallelized by the GPU to enhance its performance.

It require Visual Studio 2015 upper, OpenCV 3.2, Cuda 8.0.
